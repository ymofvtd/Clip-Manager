# VideoTrayApp

A Windows system tray app that monitors video folders and helps organize/rename video files.

## Current Version

1.0.1

## Manual Build (Release .exe)

You need the .NET 10 SDK installed.

```powershell
# From the repo root
dotnet publish VideoTrayApp/VideoTrayApp.csproj -c Release
```

The portable single-file executable will be here:

```
VideoTrayApp/bin/Release/net10.0-windows/win-x64/publish/VideoTrayApp.exe
```

This `.exe` is self-contained (includes the .NET runtime). You can copy it anywhere and run it without installing anything else.

**Tips:**
- The file is ~110MB because it bundles the full runtime.
- Right-click the exe → Properties → Details to see version, etc.

## Releasing a New Version (Manual)

1. Update the version in `VideoTrayApp/VideoTrayApp.csproj`:
   ```xml
   <Version>1.0.2</Version>
   <AssemblyVersion>1.0.2.0</AssemblyVersion>
   <FileVersion>1.0.2.0</FileVersion>
   ```
2. Commit the change.
3. Tag and push:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.2
   git push origin v1.0.2
   ```
4. On GitHub, go to Releases → the new tag should appear (or create one manually and attach the exe).

## Automated Releases (Recommended)

This repo uses GitHub Actions to build and publish releases automatically.

### How to trigger an automated release

**Option A – Using Git tags (recommended)**

```bash
# Update version in .csproj if you want
git add .
git commit -m "chore: prepare v1.0.2"
git tag v1.0.2
git push origin main --tags
```

Pushing the `v*` tag will:
- Build a clean Release `VideoTrayApp-1.0.2.exe`
- Create a GitHub Release
- Attach the executable

**Option B – Manual trigger**

1. Go to your repo on GitHub → **Actions** tab
2. Select **"Build and Release"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. (Optional) Enter the version (e.g. `1.0.2`)
5. Run it

After it finishes, the Release will appear under **Releases** and the exe will be attached.

### Workflow file

See `.github/workflows/release.yml`

## Notes

- The app uses `PublishSingleFile` + `SelfContained` so one exe works on any Windows 10/11 machine (x64).
- No .NET runtime needs to be pre-installed on the target computer.
- The tray app hides itself and lives in the notification area.

## Development

```powershell
dotnet build
# or run the project
dotnet run --project VideoTrayApp
```
